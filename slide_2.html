                <h1>What was the effect of state-level policies on the spread and severity of COVID-19?</h1>
                <p>Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, different states enacted different degrees of social-distancing policies. As a direct consequence of these policies, the COVID-19 pandemic was either curbed or exacerbated. Therefore, this visualization attempts to understand which states enacted the best or worst policies by analyzing the spread of the pandemic. This information can be used for future pandemics and epidemics to determine what best practices to put in place.</p>

                            <p>The visualization above showcases how different degrees of policy enforcements results in the increase or decrease of the fatality ratio. Fatality ratio here is defined as the number of fatalities divided by the total population of the state. </p>
                            <p>Each COVID-19 related policy was categorized into 3 types:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Contact Reduction: </strong> These policies were aimed at curbing the spread of the virus directly by prohibiting contact between people. Examples of these policies include closure of bars and restaurants.</li>
                                <li><strong>Mask/Vaccination Related Policies:</strong> These policies were aimed at getting people to wear masks in public or mandating vaccinations in certain populations. Examples of these policies include mandatory mask requirement in schools.</li>
                                <li><strong>Notification:</strong> These policies were about increasing awareness or providing other forms of support to people such as tax relief or reducing evictions.</strong></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>For this analysis we performed a weighted average of the number of policies to determine strict, moderate, and lax states. The weight ratio was 5:10:1 respectively. States that had a normalized weighted average of greater than 90% were deemed strict states. States that had a normalized weighted average of greater than 70% were deemed moderate states. All remaining states were deemed Lax.</p>
