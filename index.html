                <h1>What was the effect of state-level policies on the spread and severity of COVID-19?</h1>
                <p>Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, different states enacted different degrees of social-distancing policies. As a direct consequence of these policies, the COVID-19 pandemic was either curbed or exacerbated. Therefore, this visualization attempts to understand which states enacted the best or worst policies by analyzing the spread of the pandemic. This information can be used for future pandemics and epidemics to determine what best practices to put in place.</p>

                    <p>This visualization is structured as an interactive slideshow containing 3 different slides. The query and menubar will always be present at the top for ease of navigation. Each of the 4 slides are described below:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Slide 1:</strong> A boxplot showcasing the impact of stricter or looser restrictions on the spread of covid infections normalized by the population.</li>
                        <li><strong>Slide 2:</strong> A boxplot showcasing the impact of strict or loose restrictions on the number of COVID-19 related fatalities normalized by the population.</li>
                        <li><strong>Slide 3:</strong> A lineplot of the number of COVID-19 infections and COVID-19 related fatalities overlayed with the occurence of different types of restrictions by state.</li>
